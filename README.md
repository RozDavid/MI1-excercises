# Machine Intelligence 1. Excercise sheets
The goal is to finish the python notebooks as a preparation for the exam and create a good collection of ideas with implementations.

Also if on your computer the training takes a lot of time, you should consider copying the notebook and run the model optimization on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
(Should set up runtime to use acceleration. Also might need to modify a few lines to utilize GPUs there)
